***PWM***

This example demonstrates the use pulse width modulation (PWM) to increase or decrease brightness of led 
when you gradually increase or decrease your PWM value from 0 (all the way off) to 200 (all the way on)

**Hardware Required:**

STM32F4 Discovery board

LED

2 Push Button

330-ohm resistor

hook-up wires

breadboard


**Circuit**


Connect the anode of your LED to digital output PE9 on your board through a 330-ohm resistor. Connect the cathode (the shorter, negative leg) directly to ground.

Connect 2 push button to PB0 and PB1.
